Document your design decisions here so that they are available for everyone to
see. This will be especially important from code generation on since we will
be making more and more decisions and it will be harder to keep track of
everything in our brains.

IR Generation
- IRCall(f,e1,...,en) evaluates to the entries in _RET0, regardless of
whether f returns multiple things or just one thing. This is for
convenience so that expr func calls (which necessarily only return 1
value) do not need to do anything weird like moving stuff from _RET0.
This means that in DeclAsgns with multiple variables, move the first
variable from the IRCall, the second from _RET1, etc.
