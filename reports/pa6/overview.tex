\section{Metadata}\label{sec:metadata}
% The fully qualified class name of your main program and any other
% instructions needed to run the program.
We implemented programming assignment $1$ and $2$ in Java, but we implemented
programming assignment $3,4,5$, and $6$ in OCaml. Our main OCaml executable is
implemented in \texttt{main.ml} inside the \texttt{src} directory. To run our
code, you will need to install a couple of packages and OCaml libraries by
running the following:

\begin{center}
\begin{BVerbatim}
sudo apt-get install aspcud m4 unzip
opam install core async oUnit ocamlgraph bisect
\end{BVerbatim}
\end{center}

To build our executable, simply run \texttt{make src}. This will use
\texttt{jflex}, \texttt{cup}, and \texttt{javac} and build all of our Java
code. It will use \texttt{corebuild} to build our OCaml code. Invoking our
code manually is hard; instead, we we recommend you use the \texttt{xic} script
which invokes our code with everything configured properly. 
In summary, perform the following:

\begin{center}
\begin{BVerbatim}
sudo apt-get install aspcud m4 unzip
opam install core async oUnit ocamlgraph bisect
make src
./xic [flags] <xi_file.xi>...
\end{BVerbatim}
\end{center}

See the \texttt{opam} file for more information regarding our OCaml dependencies.


\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
In this programming assignment, we implemented several optimizations for our compiler - register allocation, conditional constant propagation, and partial-redundancy elimination (which also implements common subexpression elimination).
The most challenging part of this assignment was implementing register allocation. Major design decisions for this project include strictly following Appel's implementation of register allocation, following Dragon's implementation of partial-redundancy elimination, and coalescing spilled nodes.
There are no known bugs or missing functionality in our implementation.

\section{Specification}\label{sec:specification}
For this project, we have not deviated from the project specification. We heavily followed the psuedocode provided by Appel and Dragon for register allocation and partial-redundancy elimination, respectively. The only slight deviation was in register allocation, where Appel did not mention that spilled nodes should be coalesced. In order for register allocation to work properly, we assigned nodes whose alias was a spilled node to point to the same address in the stack.

\section{Design and Implementation}\label{sec:design}
\subsection{Architecture}
Our optimizations are implemented by the following modules.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{regalloc}
    This module implements register allocation and relies on \texttt{cfg} and \texttt{dataflow}.
    
  \item \texttt{ccp}
    This module implements conditional constant propagation and relies on \texttt{cfg} and \texttt{dataflow}.
    
  \item \texttt{pre}
    This module implements partial-redundancy elimination and relies on \texttt{cfg} and \texttt{dataflow}.

  \item \texttt{cfg}
    This module contains a representation of a control-flow graph.

  \item \texttt{dataflow}
    This module implements a lattic and generic dataflow analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Design}

\subsubsection{Optimized Register Allocation with Move Coalescing}
The data structures and algorithm we use for optimized register allocation intensely follow those mentioned in section 11.4 of Appel's book. The only addition we made to Appel's register allocation algorithm was coalescing spilled nodes. Any node with an alias that is spilled is assigned the same pointer in the stack so that they are properly coalesced. This was necessary because the node cannot point to any pointer in the stack - it must point to the same location as its alias points to.

\subsubsection{Partial-Redundancy Elimination}
We relied heavily on Dragon's implementation of partial-redundancy elimination (PRE). Similar to Appel's register allocation algorithm, we had to make a few additions to Dragon's PRE algorithm to have a functional and correct PRE. For example, we had to decide how to change the CFG back into a series of IR statements.

\subsubsection{Conditional Constant Propagation}
We gathered inspiration for this algorithm from lecture and from Appel. We followed the module structure for lattices defined in \texttt{cfg} to create the analysis for conditional constant propagation. To get rid of some unnecessary jumps and branches, we simply called block reordering from pa4.


\subsection{Programming}
We followed a top-down implementation strategy, defining the interfaces and modules before finally gluing together each
component. This top-down approach made it easy to
divide work between team members and maximized modularity. Each team member was able to work on different modules and implement different components in parallel. For example, one team member worked on general dataflow analysis while another team member was able to assume the interface for dataflow to construct live variable analysis and work on other parts of register allocation. All optimizations followed this top-down strategy because having the interfaces first made it clear to other members of the group what they could expect from each module.

The most challenging part of the assignment was debugging register allocation. Register allocation itself is a very involved algorithm, in addition to depending on other components, such as live variable analysis and control-flow graphs. Debugging required generating assembly and examining and analyzing the assembly to understand the source of our bugs.

Our work allocation is described in \secref{workplan}.

\section{Testing}\label{sec:testing}
As usual, we have implemented a very comprehensive set of tests that range in
scale and scope. First, we have implemented the typical unit tests for each major
code component (e.g. partial-redundancy elimination). This ensured that our functions behaved as
expected and validated many of our assumptions regarding our optimization algorithms.

We also wrote and ran many functional tests. This was done within
an automated framework that required us only to write high-level Xi programs. This
framework performed testing in a novel manner: for each stage of our compiler from
typechecking, AST constant folding, IR generation, IR lowering, IR block reordering,
all the way to assembly generation, both with naive and non-naive tiling, we generate
output and use the Xi interpreter written by Seung Hee for pa4,
the provided IR interpreter, and gcc to link assembly programs and execute them on our
machines. We then diff the outputs from all of these executions. This allowed us to validate that the stages of our compiler were still working from the previous programming assignments.

The testing method that helped us debug the most intricate bugs was generating the assembly and analyzing it to understand what would cause our tests to fail, infinitely loop, etc. We should have used this method earlier on in the project because register allocation is a very involved algorithm and even our unit tests were too high level to isolate where the bugs were occurring.

In addition to all of these testing methods, we wrote several benchmarks that clearly showed off our optimizations. For example, we have a few programs that have many live variables throughout the program that would be spilled in naive register allocation but would be allocated registers in smart register allocation. Not having to access memory causes a huge speedup and is demonstrated by this benchmark.

We pass all of our tests.
\section{Work Plan}\label{sec:workplan}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ralph.}
    Ralph worked on the front-end, set up the data analysis framework, and helped implement and debug register allocation.

  \item \textbf{Alice.}
    Alice worked on register allocation and helped test the generated CFGs and conditional constant propagation.

  \item \textbf{Seung Hee.}
    Seung Hee implemented conditional constant propagation and partial-redundancy elimination.

  \item \textbf{Michael.}
    Michael worked on partial-redundancy elimination, extensive debugging in register allocation, and making the dot files.
\end{itemize}

The work was divided in this way because it parallelized our work in the most
effective manner.

\section{Known Problems}\label{sec:problems}
Currently we do not support UTF-8 as OCaml does not have good support for
unicode escapes. We also sometimes report incorrect file positions in our error
messages.

\section{Comments}\label{sec:comments}
We spent about 120 hours total on the assignment. As usual, we spent over an
order of magnitude more time writing tests and gluing things together than we
did writing actual code. The assignment was hard because the algorithms had many intricate details and testing became much
more challenging.
